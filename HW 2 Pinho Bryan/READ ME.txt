I tested my website in different browsers and they render the css little different from each other. The three columns don’t dynamically update when you resize the screen. The width of the columns is fixed. Therefore, when you decrease the size of the screen the right panel is pulled to the next line. Because the screen of a mobile device is so small, you need to scroll right and down to see the three columns. It is not mobile or user experience friendly at all. It was a great project to learn CSS but I don’t think it is a good idea to implement in a live website.
